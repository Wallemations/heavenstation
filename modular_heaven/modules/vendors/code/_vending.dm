	Here's a template for adding and removing items.
	Just list the typepath of the vendor you want modify and edit the three lists accordingly.

	An item not already in the list will be added with the value you set.
	An item already in the list will have it's amount adjusted by the value you set.
	If you set a negative value, it will remove items from an existing item.

	If an item's amount is below 0 after adjusting it, it will be removed from the list entirely.
	Use -99 if you want an item to be guaranteed removed from the list.
